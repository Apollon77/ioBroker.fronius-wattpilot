**Tests:** ![Test and Release](https://github.com/tim2zg/ioBroker.fronius-wattpilot/workflows/Test%20and%20Release/badge.svg)

Barebones implementation of the unofficial Fronius Watt pilot (https://www.fronius.com/de-ch/switzerland/solarenergie/installateure-partner/technische-daten/alle-produkte/l%C3%B6sungen/fronius-wattpilot) API. Based on https://github.com/joscha82/wattpilot.
Iâ€™m only 15 years old, and my code style/quality is really bad. Hope you can use it. 

I don't take the responsibility for your device. With this API you can access the device directly, be careful.
